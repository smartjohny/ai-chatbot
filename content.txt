Example: An IoT-based weather station can use a temperature sensor to monitor environmental conditions and send real-time data to the cloud.

### Machine Learning 
Machine learning (ML) is a branch of AI that allows computers to learn and improve from data without being explicitly programmed. Types of machine learning: 
- **Supervised Learning** – The model is trained on labeled data (e.g., classification). 
- **Unsupervised Learning** – The model is trained on unlabelled data (e.g., clustering).

### Wireless Communication 
Wireless communication refers to the transfer of information between two or more devices without physical connections. It uses electromagnetic waves like radio waves, infrared, and microwaves. 

Types of wireless communication: 
- **Wi-Fi** – Local area wireless networking using IEEE 802.11 standards. 
- **Bluetooth** – Short-range communication technology (up to 100 meters). 
- **LoRa** – Long-range, low-power communication for IoT devices. 

Frequency bands: 
- **2.4 GHz** – Used for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

### Cloud Computing 
Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services (servers, storage, databases) over the internet. Cloud models: 
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)** – Virtualized computing resources (e.g., AWS EC2). 
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)** – Development platforms (e.g., Google App Engine). 
- **SaaS (Software as a Service)** – Hosted applications (e.g., Gmail).

- **Entanglement** – Qubits can be interconnected and influence each other. 
- **Interference** – Used to amplify correct answers and cancel out wrong ones. 

### Edge Computing 
Edge computing involves processing data closer to the source (device) rather than relying on a centralized cloud. 
Advantages: 
- **Reduced Latency** – Faster data processing. 
- **Lower Bandwidth Usage** – Less data transferred to the cloud. 
- **Increased Security** – Sensitive data processed locally.
